## 2025-09-25 - Initial Research Turn

**Timestamp:** 2025-09-25T00:00:00Z

**Inputs Considered:**
- Task: Implement infinite canvas application for code diagram visualization
- Requirements: 2D infinite canvas, keyboard-only controls, shape creation/connection, dynamic arrows, auto camera control
- Context: Modern web environment, performance requirements for 100+ nodes

**Decisions Made:**
- Created research structure under docs/research/infinite-canvas-drawing/
- Identified 6 primary solution avenues: Custom Canvas2D, WebGL engines, existing diagram libraries, SVG approaches, game engines, hybrid solutions
- Planned breadth-first research approach covering rendering engines, infinite canvas patterns, keyboard navigation, and performance optimization

**Files Created:**
- infinite-canvas-drawing.md (main research file)
- CHANGELOG.md (this file)
- Directory structure: SNIPPETS/, ARCH/

**Next Actions:**
- Conduct breadth scan of infinite canvas solutions
- Research canvas rendering performance comparisons
- Investigate existing diagram library capabilities
- Document keyboard navigation patterns

## 2025-09-25 - Comprehensive Research Completion

**Timestamp:** 2025-09-25T23:59:59Z

**Research Completed:**

**Breadth Analysis**:
- Surveyed 7 major approaches: tldraw, React Flow, Konva.js, PixiJS, GoJS, Excalidraw, Native Canvas2D
- Created comprehensive comparison table with licensing, performance, and fit analysis
- Identified key trade-offs between development speed, performance, and control

**Depth Analysis - Canvas Engines**:
- Deep dive into Canvas2D (Konva.js), WebGL (PixiJS), and native implementations
- Created working code examples for each approach
- Analyzed performance characteristics and integration complexity
- Documented when to use each rendering approach

**Depth Analysis - Diagram Libraries**:
- Extensive analysis of React Flow + keyboard extensions
- tldraw SDK customization for diagramming workflows
- GoJS enterprise features and keyboard navigation
- Complete working examples for each library approach

**Depth Analysis - Keyboard Navigation**:
- Researched spatial navigation algorithms and patterns
- Auto-focus camera systems with smooth transitions
- Mode-based shortcut systems for different interaction states
- Accessibility considerations and screen reader integration

**Code Artifacts Created**:
- SNIPPETS/viewport-system.ts - Complete viewport management system
- SNIPPETS/keyboard-navigation.ts - Comprehensive keyboard navigation with spatial algorithms
- Multiple working examples integrated into depth analysis files

**Final Recommendation:**
- Primary: Konva.js + Custom Keyboard Navigation (best balance of control and development speed)
- Fallback: React Flow + Keyboard Extensions (for React apps with tight timelines)  
- Alternative: tldraw SDK (for commercial apps needing professional features)

**Files Updated/Created:**
- infinite-canvas-drawing.md (complete synthesis with recommendations)
- BREADTH.md (landscape comparison table)
- DEPTH-canvas-engines.md (Canvas2D, WebGL, SVG analysis)
- DEPTH-diagram-libs.md (React Flow, tldraw, GoJS deep dives)
- DEPTH-keyboard-navigation.md (navigation patterns and accessibility)
- SOURCES.jsonl (complete source metadata)
- SNIPPETS/viewport-system.ts (core viewport implementation)
- SNIPPETS/keyboard-navigation.ts (complete navigation system)
- CHANGELOG.md (this comprehensive log)

**Key Insights:**
1. No existing solution provides keyboard-first navigation out of the box - custom implementation required
2. Canvas2D performance through Konva.js is sufficient for 100+ node diagrams
3. Spatial navigation is critical for intuitive keyboard control in 2D canvas
4. Auto-focus camera system essential for smooth keyboard-only user experience
5. Development timeline: 2-3 weeks for full custom implementation vs 1 week for React Flow extension

**Ready for Implementation:**
Research provides complete path to implementation with working code examples, performance considerations, risk mitigation strategies, and clear success metrics.
