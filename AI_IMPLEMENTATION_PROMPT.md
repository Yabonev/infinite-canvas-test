## Your Current Task

### Task IC-000: Project Initialization

**Objective**: Initialize the React + TypeScript + Vite project with all necessary dependencies and create the foundational structure.

**Working Directory**: `/Users/yabo/Documents/Code/sound-design/tests/infinite-canvas-test`

**Step-by-Step Instructions**:

1. **Initialize Vite Project**:
   ```bash
   # Create Vite project with React TypeScript template
   npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
   
   # When prompted, confirm to proceed in non-empty directory
   ```

2. **Install Core Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Install runtime dependencies
   npm install konva react-konva zustand styled-components framer-motion
   npm install @types/styled-components
   
   # Install development dependencies
   npm install -D vitest @vitest/ui @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event @testing-library/jest-dom
   npm install -D @playwright/test
   npm install -D eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
   npm install -D prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier
   npm install -D husky lint-staged
   ```

3. **Configure TypeScript** (strict mode):
   - Update `tsconfig.json` with strict settings
   - Enable all strict checks
   - Set up path aliases for clean imports

4. **Set Up Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Create `vite.config.ts` with test configuration
   - Create `playwright.config.ts` for E2E tests
   - Set up test utilities and fixtures

5. **Create Project Structure**:
   ```
   src/
   ├── core/
   │   ├── viewport/
   │   ├── navigation/
   │   ├── shapes/
   │   └── connections/
   ├── components/
   ├── hooks/
   ├── stores/
   ├── types/
   └── utils/
   ```

6. **Configure Linting and Formatting**:
   - Set up ESLint with TypeScript rules
   - Configure Prettier
   - Set up Husky pre-commit hooks

7. **Initialize Git and Create First Commit**:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "chore: initialize project with React + TypeScript + Vite
   
   - Set up Vite with React and TypeScript
   - Install Konva.js and react-konva for canvas
   - Configure Zustand for state management
   - Set up testing with Vitest and Playwright
   - Configure ESLint and Prettier
   - Create initial project structure"
   ```

8. **Run Setup Script** (if GitHub repo needed):
   ```bash
   ./setup-github.sh
   ```

9. **Verify Everything Works**:
   ```bash
   # Start dev server
   npm run dev
   
   # In another terminal, run tests
   npm test
   
   # Check linting
   npm run lint
   ```

10. **Test with Playwright MCP**:
    - Use `playwright_browser_navigate` to open the dev server
    - Take a screenshot to verify the app loads
    - Document the initial state

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Project builds successfully
- [ ] Dev server runs on http://localhost:5173
- [ ] All dependencies installed
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode enabled
- [ ] Testing infrastructure ready
- [ ] Linting and formatting configured
- [ ] Git repository initialized
- [ ] Initial commit created

**Deliverables**:
- Working React + TypeScript + Vite project
- All dependencies installed and configured
- Testing infrastructure ready
- Clean project structure created
- Ready for Task IC-001 (Viewport System)

## Next Task Preview

After completing IC-000, you'll move to:

**Task IC-001: Implement Viewport System**
- Copy and adapt `viewport-system.ts` from research
- Create ViewportManager with pan/zoom
- Write comprehensive tests
- Integrate with React using Context
- Test with Playwright MCP

## Working Principles

1. **Test First**: Always write failing tests before implementation
2. **Small PRs**: Keep changes under 500 lines
3. **Verify Continuously**: Run the app and test after each change
4. **Use Playwright MCP**: Test UI interactions with browser automation
5. **Follow AGENTS.md**: Use the documented workflow for consistency
6. **Commit Often**: Make atomic commits with clear messages

## Available Playwright MCP Tools

- `playwright_browser_navigate` - Navigate to URLs
- `playwright_browser_snapshot` - Capture page state
- `playwright_browser_click` - Click elements
- `playwright_browser_type` - Type text
- `playwright_browser_press_key` - Keyboard shortcuts
- `playwright_browser_take_screenshot` - Visual verification
- `playwright_browser_wait_for` - Wait for elements/conditions

## Command Format for Tasks

When executing tasks, follow this pattern:

```typescript
// 1. Announce the task
console.log("Starting Task IC-XXX: [Description]");

// 2. Create feature branch
await exec("git checkout -b feature/IC-XXX-feature-name");

// 3. Write tests first
// Create test files before implementation

// 4. Implement feature
// Use existing code snippets where available

// 5. Run tests
await exec("npm test");

// 6. Test with dev server
await exec("npm run dev");
await playwright_browser_navigate({ url: "http://localhost:5173" });

// 7. Create E2E tests
// Write Playwright tests for user workflows

// 8. Commit and push
await exec("git add -A");
await exec('git commit -m "feat(scope): description"');
await exec("git push -u origin feature/IC-XXX-feature-name");
```

## Error Handling

If you encounter errors:
1. Read error messages carefully
2. Check the troubleshooting section in AGENTS.md
3. Verify Node.js version is 20+
4. Clear node_modules and reinstall if needed
5. Check port 5173 is available
6. Ensure all dependencies are installed

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics for each task:
- Tests passing: 100%
- Coverage: >80%
- Build time: <30s
- No linting errors
- No TypeScript errors
- PR size: <500 lines

## Start Implementation

Begin with Task IC-000: Project Initialization. Follow the step-by-step instructions above. After each step, verify success before proceeding. Use Playwright MCP tools to test the UI whenever the dev server is running.

Remember: You're building a keyboard-first infinite canvas that will revolutionize how developers visualize code relationships. Every line of code should support this vision of speed, efficiency, and accessibility.

Good luck! Start by running:
```bash
cd /Users/yabo/Documents/Code/sound-design/tests/infinite-canvas-test
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
```
